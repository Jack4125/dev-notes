## Paradigms

### Functional Programming

Learning functional programming will help you write more readable, robust code that minimizes side effects. More importantly, functional programming trains a developer to break down a bigger problem into smaller, reusable parts.This is a very important concept to understand when writing algorithms. A problem can generally be broken down into smaller sets of problems that need to be solved.

### Object Oriented Programming

Learning to think Object-oriented trains developers to see the relationship between various objects that interact with one another. Often, when writing algorithms in the real world, there will often be interactions between two or more parties. Having the eye to see the interactions and to design your algorithms or classes in an effective and scalable manner will help you write coherent, robust solutions to problems.

- Encapsulation - put everything into an object. changes to the object does not affect anything else.
- Abstraction - hide away complexity of inner workings, only expose what's needed so interface is simple.
- Inheritance - class -> objects
- Polymorphism - "many + forms" refactor if/else/switch statements

### Imperative

Write out step-by-step procedure.

### Declarative

Declare the state of the program and let it "react".
