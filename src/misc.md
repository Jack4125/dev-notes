## Paradigms

### Functional Programming

Learning functional programming will help you write more readable, robust code that minimizes side effects. More importantly, functional programming trains a developer to break down a bigger problem into smaller, reusable parts.This is a very important concept to understand when writing algorithms. A problem can generally be broken down into smaller sets of problems that need to be solved.

**Functional programming, summed up in tens words is: pure functions, avoid shared state, mutable data and side-effects.**

#### Pure Function

- Given a certain input, it will always yield the same result for that input.
- The function always returns an original object after performing the operation it is supposed to do.
- Does not rely on any external mutable state.

### Object Oriented Programming

Learning to think Object-oriented trains developers to see the relationship between various objects that interact with one another. Often, when writing algorithms in the real world, there will often be interactions between two or more parties. Having the eye to see the interactions and to design your algorithms or classes in an effective and scalable manner will help you write coherent, robust solutions to problems.

- Encapsulation - put everything into an object. changes to the object does not affect anything else.
- Abstraction - hide away complexity of inner workings, only expose what's needed so interface is simple.
- Inheritance - class -> objects
- Polymorphism - "many + forms" refactor if/else/switch statements

### Imperative

Write out step-by-step procedure.

### Declarative

Declare the state of the program and let it "react".

## Computer Building

### CPU Speed

- Having a high clock speed but just one or two cores means your computer will be able to load and interact with a single application quickly.
- Conversely, having more processor cores, but a slower clock speed means your computer can work with more applications at a time, but each may run a little slower.
