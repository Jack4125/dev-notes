## Interview

- S.A.R (Situation, Action, Response)

  Example:

  > “Tell me about a challenging interaction with a teammate.”

  Situation:

  > On my operating systems project, I was assigned to work with three other people. While two were great, the third team member didn’t contribute much. He stayed quiet during meetings, rarely chipped in during email discussions, and struggled to complete his components.

  Action:

  > One day after class, I pulled him aside to speak about the course and then moved the discussion into talking about the project. I asked him open-ended questions on how he felt it was going, and which components he was excited about tackling. He suggested all the easiest components, and yet offered to do the write-up. I realized then that he wasn’t lazy – he was actually just really confused about the project and lacked confidence. I worked with him after that to break down the components into smaller pieces, and I made sure to complement him a lot on his work to boost his confidence.

  Result:

  > He was still the weakest member of the team, but he got a lot better. He was able to finish all his work on time, and he contributing more in discussions. We were happy to work with him on a future project.

- Be specific but focus on key points:

  > "By examining the most common user behavior and applying the Rabin-Karp algorithm, I designed a new algorithm to reduce search from O(n) to O(log n) in 90% of cases. I can go into more details if you’d like."

- You’re not done until the interviewer says that you’re done!

  > When you come up with an algorithm, start thinking about the problems accompanying it. When you write code, start trying to find bugs. If you’re anything like the other 110 candidates that I’ve interviewed, you probably made some mistakes.

- ![solve-problems](../images/solve-problems.png)

- Test edge cases (0, negative, null, maximums, etc.) and User errors (wrong input type)

- Did you know that you can write bug-free code while still doing horribly on a coding question? It’s true! Duplicated code, messy data structures (i.e., lack of object oriented design), etc. When you write code, imagine you’re writing for real-world maintainability. Break code into sub-routines, and design data structures to link appropriate data.

- When you notice problems in your code, really think deeply about why your code failed before fixing the mistake. Do not recognized a mistake and try making “random” or temporary changes to fix the error.

## Questions to Ask

- For developers in my position, what percentage of their day is spent on coding, meetings, interacting with other developers.
- I'm interested in backend development. Are there opportunities in this company to work with or in backend teams.

## Testimonies

> getting the right answer, and I thought I didn't get the job. However, the next day, I got a phone call and received glowing reviews. I asked my boss why I was hired despite that I didn't get all the answers. He said I was very friendly, honest, and was capable of saying, "I don't know," instead of trying to bullshit them. They didn't just care what I knew, but also what my potential was and how well my personality fits with their culture. So, the interview process being "human" was certainly right in my case.
